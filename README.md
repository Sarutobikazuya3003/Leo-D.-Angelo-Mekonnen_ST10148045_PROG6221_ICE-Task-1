This is a C# console application that calculates the allocation of scripts to be marked by lecturers based on user input. It prompts the user to input the total number of scripts to be marked, the number of questions in the test, the subtotals for each question, and the number of lecturers who will mark the scripts.

Then it calculates the number of scripts each lecturer will mark and estimates the time it will take each lecturer to finish marking. Finally, it displays the allocation results to the user and waits for the user to press any key to exit.
